# 🧾 CRUD App - MERN Stack

## 📋 Summary

This project is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built with the **MERN stack** — MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. It allows users to create and manage records (like users, products, tasks, etc.) through a responsive and interactive UI.

This is ideal for learning full-stack development basics and understanding the integration of frontend and backend via RESTful APIs.
